## Project Information
A simple 2D game, featuring a curious character who enters into a strange 
series of rooms and explores his new location. Along the way, he
must solve a few puzzles by interacting with a series of items that
litter the floor of the rooms, including peculiar looking keys and
disks that can be used to unlock various doors as the player moves
through the maze of rooms. The game ends when he has successfully
left the final room and escaped the maze.

JavaFX version 21, id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'

## Package Structure
For the creation of this game, strict MVC was followed to keep the 
JavaFX simple and easy to understand for all developers. The 
GameMain class runs the game. The Model is broken up more into several
packages, the first holds all game objects, such as keys and walls,
as well as the three interfaces that the game objects might implement.
The second package contains everything pertaining to the player,
including an Enum that controls direction, the inventory that holds
the player's items, and the player itself. The third package contains
the puzzles and the interface for the puzzle, which determine how
a puzzle can be solved and what happens when the puzzle is solved.
The final package is room which contains the room class, which creates
a 2D array of sprites to populate a room, the room manager, which 
actually populates the room and determines which room is being visualized,
and an Enum that holds the types of sprites to be displayed in the 
room.
